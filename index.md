### Projects:
* [YodaQA](https://github.com/S-Ercan/yodaqa)
<br />
A fork of the original [YodaQA](https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa) project, with my work contained in the ``dutch`` branch. As part of my Computer Science Master's Thesis, I'm working on getting the system to handle Dutch questions and sources. The system has an architecture based on [Apache UIMA](http://uima.apache.org/), uses DBpedia and Wikipedia as its sources, and analyzes natural language using a variety of NLP tools (parser, named entity recognizer, word nets, etc.).
* [QLearning](https://github.com/S-Ercan/QLearning)
<br />
Reinforcement learning agent learning to navigate a maze containing rewards and punishments using the Q-learning technique.
It is implemented in Java and uses a graphical representation to illustrate the learning process.
<br />
Based on the sections about Q-learning in the Reinforcement Learning chapter of _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_.
* [NewsClassification](https://github.com/S-Ercan/NewsClassification)
<br />
Machine learning project in Python for predicting the popularity of news articles, expressed in number of comments.
<br />
It contains components for crawling and collecting the articles, for preprocessing them, and for training and evaluating various classifiers on them.
