### Projects:

* [schiphol-app](https://github.com/ercanse/schiphol-app)
<br /> Application to collect data and calculate statistics using the Schiphol API.
* [schiphol-app-ui](https://github.com/ercanse/schiphol-app-ui)
<br /> A React application serving as the front end for [schiphol-app](https://github.com/ercanse/schiphol-app).  
See [demo](http://3.19.62.26:4000).
* [flight-track](https://github.com/S-Ercan/flight-track)
<br /> A Flask web app with a Python back end that scrapes data from [planefinder.net](http://planefinder.net/).  
See [demo](http://3.17.146.58:2080/flights).
* [QLearning](https://github.com/ercanse/QLearning)
<br /> Reinforcement learning agent learning to navigate a maze containing rewards and punishments using the Q-learning technique.
It is implemented in Java and uses a graphical representation to illustrate the learning process.
<br /> Based on the sections about Q-learning in the Reinforcement Learning chapter of _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_.
* [YodaQA](https://github.com/ercanse/yodaqa)
<br /> A fork of the original [YodaQA](https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa) project, with my work contained in the ``dutch`` branch. As part of my Computer Science Master's Thesis, I'm working on getting the system to handle Dutch questions and sources. The system has an architecture based on [Apache UIMA](http://uima.apache.org/), uses DBpedia and Wikipedia as its sources, and analyzes natural language using a variety of NLP tools (parser, named entity recognizer, word nets, etc.).
* [stock](https://github.com/ercanse/stock)
<br /> Java-based machine learning project for determining trends in stock data. Incrementally builds up a dataset and uses Apache Spark to run a clustering algorithm to cluster together stock symbols that have recently been trending in similar directions.
* [stock-ui](https://github.com/ercanse/stock-ui)
<br /> A React application serving as the front end for [stock](https://github.com/ercanse/stock).
